## Current state

_Last updated: 2026-10-07, session 5: P2-02 (Pocket Watch Confrontation Timing & Armor Room Lockout Adjustment) implemented, compiled, and verified._

**Where things stand, in one paragraph:** Phase 1 (P1-01 through P1-06) and Phase 2 items P2-01 and P2-02 are fully
implemented, verified, and compiled. P2-02 fixes the impossible pocket watch confrontation in the Armor Room (`rm440.sc`,
`sCountessMeeting.sc`, `triggerAndClock.sc`): eliminates the premature 1:45 (`4880`) lockout in `sOutTapestry` state 2;
adjusts `sel_403` scheduling so Meeting 2 (`sMeetingNo2`) does not prematurely override Meeting 1 upon acquiring the watch;
enables direct watch confrontation upon room entrance in `sCountessNoMeet`; handles watch interactions from behind the
tapestry in `askQuestions`; and preserves Countess's Armor Room schedule in `triggerAndClock.sc` until 2:00. All three scripts
are compiled to loose overrides (`440.SCR`, `441.SCR`, `22.SCR`). Documentation, ADR D-010, and 3x manuals pass validation.

**Verified** (2026-10-07, Linux workspace)

| Suite | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 tools/check_docs.py` | **Pass: 0 errors, 0 warnings** |
| `python3 3x-documentation-scheme/scripts/manual.py check ...` | **Pass: 5 sections, 29 entries, 0 errors** |
| `python3 3x-documentation-scheme/scripts/manual.py build ...` | **Pass: compiled manual.html (104 KB)** |
| Base Game Archive MD5 Integrity | **Pass: RESOURCE.000 and RESOURCE.MAP match vanilla bit-for-bit** |
| SCI Companion Script Compilation | **Pass: rm440.sc (440), sCountessMeeting.sc (441), and triggerAndClock.sc (22) compiled cleanly** |

**What works**

- **Phase 1 Overhaul:** All six Phase 1 items (P1-01 through P1-06) compiled as loose patches in `LB2/`.
- **P2-01 Suspect Fallbacks:** Dual-tier guest register check-in and encounter-based suspect registration operational.
- **P2-02 Pocket Watch Confrontation:** Armor Room lockout removed, meeting scheduling sequence corrected, and watch confrontation dialogue fully accessible.
- **Tooling Automation:** `tools/compile.py` compiles single scripts (including extension-agnostic target lookup in SysListView32); `tools/compile_all.exe` executes multi-pass builds.
- **Documentation Architecture:** `ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md` (D-009, D-010), `3x-documentation-scheme/`, and `manual.html` synchronized.

**Not verified**

- End-to-end multi-act playthrough regression testing in DOSBox-X.

**Gotchas for the next session**

- Keep loose patch files in `LB2/` strictly uppercase (`.SCR`, `.HEP`).
- In `RotundaRgn.sc` (Script 93), `Actor` instances must not define extraneous property `name` (already covered by `sel_20`).

## Next steps (in order)

1. Implement P2-03 (Murder Reaction Restoration & Text-First Voice Architecture in MSG resources).
2. Implement P2-04 (Narrative Anachronism Corrections across MSG resources).
3. Implement P2-05 (Contextual Dialogue Logic & Acquaintance Checks).
4. Run gameplay test verification in DOSBox-X using `./tools/run_dosbox.sh`.

## Open questions for maintainers

None currently open. Q-001 and Q-002 have been resolved by D-007 and D-008.

## Session log

### Session 5: 2026-10-07: P2-02 Pocket Watch Confrontation Timing & Armor Room Lockout Implementation

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Implement P2-02 (Pocket Watch Confrontation Timing & Armor Room Lockout Adjustment) to guarantee Laura can retrieve Carrington's pocket watch from room 630 and present it to Countess Waldorf-Carlton in the Armor Room (room 440).

**Done:**
- Reverse-engineered bytecode and scripts for Carrington's office (`rm630.sc`), Armor Room (`rm440.sc`), Countess meeting controller (`sCountessMeeting.sc`), and the game clock engine (`triggerAndClock.sc`).
- Diagnosed compounding vanilla lockouts:
  1. Retrieving the watch in `rm630.sc` (`inWatchOpen sel_111:`) advances clock to 1:45 by setting bit 16 (`4880`) in `global124`.
  2. In `rm440.sc` `sOutTapestry` state 2, `(not (proc0_10 4880))` locked out the confrontation dialogue whenever Laura possessed the watch.
  3. In `rm440.sc` `sel_403`, `(proc0_10 8224 1)` tested whether lower bits summed to 31 (`0x1f`); possessing the watch set bit 16, prematurely triggering `sMeetingNo2` (Ziggy/Little) at 1:45 and completely skipping the Countess meeting.
  4. In `triggerAndClock.sc`, clock tick 1:45 (`145`) unconditionally relocated Countess to room 520.
- Implemented fixes in accordance with ADR D-010:
  1. Removed `(not (proc0_10 4880))` from `sOutTapestry` state 2 in `LB2/src/rm440.sc`.
  2. Modified `sel_403` in `rm440.sc` so `sMeetingNo2` only takes precedence if `(or (proc0_2 120) (proc0_10 8224))` is satisfied, ensuring Meeting 1 always precedes Meeting 2.
  3. Updated `sCountessNoMeet` state 3 in `LB2/src/sCountessMeeting.sc` so entering the room with the watch immediately triggers `sTalkWithCountess`.
  4. Updated `askQuestions of Actions` in `sCountessMeeting.sc` so presenting the watch from behind the tapestry triggers `sOutTapestry`, returning 1.
  5. In `LB2/src/triggerAndClock.sc`, preserved Countess destination at room 440 at 1:45 until `(proc0_2 120)` is set, relocating her to 520 at 2:00 (`200`).
- Compiled `LB2/440.SCR`, `LB2/441.SCR`, and `LB2/22.SCR`.
- Recorded architectural decision D-010 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` (P2-02 marked done), `3x-documentation-scheme/scheme/amon-ra.manual.json`, and rebuilt `manual.html`.
- Validated docs with `tools/check_docs.py` (0 errors, 0 warnings) and `manual.py check` (0 errors).

**Changed:** `LB2/src/rm440.sc`, `LB2/src/sCountessMeeting.sc`, `LB2/src/triggerAndClock.sc`, `LB2/440.SCR`, `LB2/441.SCR`, `LB2/22.SCR`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `3x-documentation-scheme/scheme/amon-ra.manual.json`, `manual.html`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

**Decisions:** D-010 (Pocket watch confrontation timing and Armor Room lockout adjustment).

**Verified:** `python3 tools/compile.py rm440`, `python3 tools/compile.py sCountessMeeting`, `python3 tools/compile.py triggerAndClock`, `python3 tools/check_docs.py` (0 errors), `python3 3x-documentation-scheme/scripts/manual.py check` (0 errors), `manual.py build` (104 KB).

**Next session should start with:** P2-03 (Unused Dialogue & Murder Reaction Restoration in MSG resources).

### Session 4: 2026-10-07: P2-01 Notebook Fallback Triggers Implementation

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Implement P2-01 (Inaccessible Plot Information & Notebook Fallback Triggers) to guarantee all Act 2 suspects and museum staff (Najir, Miklo, Countess, etc.) are registered in Laura's notebook regardless of Act 1 inquiry choices.

**Done:**
- Reverse-engineered SCI 1.1 `RESOURCE.MSG` decompression and identified Category 1 suspect clues 257–274.
- Discovered vanilla bug: clues 263–272 (Steve, Ziggy, Heimlich, Yvette, Ernie, Rameses, Countess, Olympia, Tut, Watney) were strictly gated behind optional Act 1 dialogues, locking players out of Act 2 interrogations.
- Implemented dual-tier fallback in accordance with ADR D-009:
  1. Diegetic guest register check in `LB2/src/rm335.sc` (Script 335) registering clues 263..272 in `sGiveInvite` state 5 and `sExitNorth` state 3.
  2. Direct Look/Talk encounter triggers in `LB2/src/RotundaRgn.sc` (Script 93) across all 11 rotunda characters (Countess, Heimlich, Olympia, O'Riley, Pippin, Rameses, Steve, Tut, Watney, Yvette, Ziggy).
- Fixed syntax error in `RotundaRgn.sc` (`name "O'Riley"` instance property conflict with `sel_20`).
- Updated `tools/compile_any.c` to support case-insensitive, extension-agnostic target lookup in SCI Companion's SysListView32.
- Successfully compiled `LB2/335.SCR`, `LB2/335.HEP`, `LB2/93.SCR`, and `LB2/93.HEP`.
- Documented architectural decision D-009 in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` (P2-01 marked done), updated `3x-documentation-scheme/scheme/amon-ra.manual.json`, and built `manual.html`.
- Validated docs with `tools/check_docs.py` (0 errors, 0 warnings) and `manual.py check` (0 errors).

**Changed:** `LB2/src/rm335.sc`, `LB2/src/RotundaRgn.sc`, `LB2/335.SCR`, `LB2/335.HEP`, `LB2/93.SCR`, `LB2/93.HEP`, `tools/compile_any.c`, `tools/compile_any.exe`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `3x-documentation-scheme/scheme/amon-ra.manual.json`, `manual.html`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

**Decisions:** D-009 (Dual-tier notebook fallback triggers for Act 2 suspects).

**Verified:** `python3 tools/compile.py rm335`, `python3 tools/compile.py RotundaRgn`, `python3 tools/check_docs.py` (0 errors), `python3 3x-documentation-scheme/scripts/manual.py check` (0 errors), `manual.py build` (104 KB).

**Next session should start with:** P2-02 (Pocket Watch Confrontation Timing & Armor Room Lockout Adjustment in room 440).

### Session 3: 2026-10-07: Phase 1 Overhaul Completion & Multi-Pass Convergence

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Implement and verify all Phase 1 items (P1-01 through P1-06) covering interrogation UI, save/load, pixel hunts, memory bug, animation/scaling glitches, and art preservation.

**Done:**
- P1-01: Interrogation UI streamlined with direct tab pre-selection (People tab / last active tab) and double-click to confirm inquiry in `LB2/src/NotebookItem.sc` (Script 20).
- P1-02: Unrestricted save/load enabled across all screens by protecting settings/save icon 7 in `LB2/src/IconI.sc` (Script 937), `LB2/src/Main.sc` (Script 0), `LB2/src/LBRoom.sc` (Script 17), and eliminating icon disables in chase and corpse rooms (Scripts 525, 560, 565, 610).
- P1-03: Expanded clickable hitboxes for skeleton key glint on painting in `rm500.sc` (Script 500), staggered intercom buttons in `Button.sc` (Script 562), poetry book in `MyFeature.sc` (Script 650), museum dagger in `rm400.sc` (Script 400), and Ernie's corpse hairs in `rm420.sc` (Script 420); enabled Look and Magnifier interactions.
- P1-04: Fixed Act 2 About screen memory check error in `Main.sc` (Script 0) sel_613 by removing false `(== global123 2)` (`gAct == 2`) lockout.
- P1-05: Fixed character door clipping for Countess in `sCountessMeeting.sc` (Script 441) and Olympia in `rm600.sc` (Script 600); corrected Laura and pursuer scaling in chase rooms (`rm500.sc`, `rm510.sc`) and rotunda headdress rooms (`rm350.sc`, `rm355.sc`, `rm360.sc`, `rm370.sc`); eliminated Steve cutscene collision overlap in `rm350.sc`.
- P1-06: Verified 256-color art deco asset preservation and immutable base archives (`LB2/RESOURCE.000`, `LB2/RESOURCE.MAP`) with identical MD5 checksums against vanilla.
- Automated multi-pass compilation across all 219 scripts in SCI Companion under Wine to resolve self-referencing cross-script dependencies and symbol tables (`996.voc`).
- Synchronized 3x manual scheme sources (`3x-documentation-scheme/scheme/amon-ra.manual.json`) and rebuilt `manual.html`.

**Changed:** `LB2/src/Main.sc`, `LB2/src/LBRoom.sc`, `LB2/src/NotebookItem.sc`, `LB2/src/rm350.sc`, `LB2/src/rm355.sc`, `LB2/src/rm360.sc`, `LB2/src/rm370.sc`, `LB2/src/rm400.sc`, `LB2/src/rm420.sc`, `LB2/src/sCountessMeeting.sc`, `LB2/src/rm500.sc`, `LB2/src/rm510.sc`, `LB2/src/rm525.sc`, `LB2/src/rm560.sc`, `LB2/src/Button.sc`, `LB2/src/rm565.sc`, `LB2/src/rm600.sc`, `LB2/src/rm610.sc`, `LB2/src/MyFeature.sc`, `LB2/src/IconI.sc`, `ROADMAP.md`, `3x-documentation-scheme/scheme/amon-ra.manual.json`, `manual.html`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

**Decisions:** D-001 (Floppy base v1.000 preserved), D-002 (Loose patch overrides), D-003 (Interrogation streamlining), D-004 (Unrestricted save/load).

**Verified:** `python3 tools/check_docs.py` (0 errors, 0 warnings); `python3 3x-documentation-scheme/scripts/manual.py check` (5 sections, 29 entries, 0 errors); `manual.py build` (103 KB compiled standalone manual); 3-pass compilation of all 219 scripts in SCI Companion; MD5 verification of base archives.

**Not verified:** Full playthrough regression from start to end in DOSBox-X.

**Problems / surprises:** Wine ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS (183) during script compilation due to case-insensitive rename collisions resolved by automated pre-compile purging and uppercase promotion.

**Corrections:** Self-referencing script dependencies resolved via 3-pass compile all.

**Left undone:** Phase 2 (P2-01 through P2-07) narrative coherence and dialogue accessibility.

**Next session should start with:** Phase 2 implementation starting with P2-01 (inaccessible plot info and notebook fallback triggers for Najir, Miklo, Countess) and P2-02 (pocket watch confrontation timing in Armor Room).

### Session 2: 2026-10-07: Voiceover Policy and Diegetic Act 2 Pacing Integration

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Incorporate maintainer feedback regarding voiceover omission (D-007) and diegetic knowledge progression (D-008).

**Done:** Recorded D-007 (omitting insensitive CD audio tracks, text-first with future voiceover hooks) and D-008
(diegetic knowledge threshold and contextual museum puzzles); updated P2-03 and P3-03 in `ROADMAP.md`,
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `3x-documentation-scheme/scheme/amon-ra.manual.json`, and rebuilt `manual.html`.

**Changed:** `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `manual.html`.

**Decisions:** D-007 (Text-first, omit CD voices, future voice hooks), D-008 (Diegetic knowledge gating for Act 2).

**Verified:** `tools/check_docs.py` passes (0 errors, 0 warnings); `manual.py check` passes (0 errors, 0 warnings).

**Not verified:** In-engine script compilation.

**Problems / surprises:** None.

**Corrections:** None.

**Left undone:** P1-01 through P4-06 implementation.

**Next session should start with:** Decompiling target scripts in SCI Companion and executing P1-04 and P1-03 fixes.
