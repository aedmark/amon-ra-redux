### Session 1: 2026-10-07: Dev Plan & Modernization Roadmap Creation

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Establish development plan, architecture, and roadmap for modernizing The Dagger of Amon Ra using the floppy
release and SCI Companion.

**Done:** Created `docs/ROADMAP.md` covering all 24 items (P1-01 through P4-06); authored `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-001 through D-006, Q-001, Q-002), `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`,
`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`; authored and compiled 3x manual `docs/manual/manual.html`.

**Changed:** Initialized project memory and documentation toolchain.

**Decisions:** D-001 (Floppy base v1.000), D-002 (Loose patch overrides), D-003 (Interrogation streamlining),
D-004 (Unrestricted save/load), D-005 (Softlock prevention), D-006 (Inquest scoring standardization).

**Verified:** `tools/check_docs.py` passes; `manual.py check` passes; ScummVM detects game; Wine executes SCI Companion.

**Not verified:** Script decompilation output and in-engine regression saves.

**Problems / surprises:** None.

**Corrections:** None.

**Left undone:** P1-01 through P4-06 implementation.

**Next session should start with:** Decompiling target scripts in SCI Companion and executing P1-04 and P1-03 fixes.
