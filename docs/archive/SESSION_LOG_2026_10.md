### Session 3: 2026-10-07: Phase 1 Overhaul Completion & Multi-Pass Convergence

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Implement and verify all Phase 1 items (P1-01 through P1-06) covering interrogation UI, save/load, pixel hunts, memory bug, animation/scaling glitches, and art preservation.

**Done:**
- P1-01: Interrogation UI streamlined with direct tab pre-selection (People tab / last active tab) and double-click to confirm inquiry in `LB2/src/NotebookItem.sc` (Script 20).
- P1-02: Unrestricted save/load enabled across all screens by protecting settings/save icon 7 in `LB2/src/IconI.sc` (Script 937), `LB2/src/Main.sc` (Script 0), `LB2/src/LBRoom.sc` (Script 17), and eliminating icon disables in chase and corpse rooms (Scripts 525, 560, 565, 610).
- P1-03: Expanded clickable hitboxes for skeleton key glint on painting in `rm500.sc` (Script 500), staggered intercom buttons in `Button.sc` (Script 562), poetry book in `MyFeature.sc` (Script 650), museum dagger in `rm400.sc` (Script 400), and Ernie's corpse hairs in `rm420.sc` (Script 420); enabled Look and Magnifier interactions.
- P1-04: Fixed Act 2 About screen memory check error in `Main.sc` (Script 0) sel_613 by removing false `(== global123 2)` (`gAct == 2`) lockout.
- P1-05: Fixed character door clipping for Countess in `sCountessMeeting.sc` (Script 441) and Olympia in `rm600.sc` (Script 600); corrected Laura and pursuer scaling in chase rooms (`rm500.sc`, `rm510.sc`) and rotunda headdress rooms (`rm350.sc`, `rm355.sc`, `rm360.sc`, `rm370.sc`); eliminated Steve cutscene collision overlap in `rm350.sc`.
- P1-06: Verified 256-color art deco asset preservation and immutable base archives (`LB2/RESOURCE.000`, `LB2/RESOURCE.MAP`) with identical MD5 checksums against vanilla.
- Automated multi-pass compilation across all 219 scripts in SCI Companion under Wine to resolve self-referencing cross-script dependencies and symbol tables (`996.voc`).
- Synchronized 3x manual scheme sources (`docs/manual/amon-ra.manual.json`) and rebuilt `docs/manual/manual.html`.

**Changed:** `LB2/src/Main.sc`, `LB2/src/LBRoom.sc`, `LB2/src/NotebookItem.sc`, `LB2/src/rm350.sc`, `LB2/src/rm355.sc`, `LB2/src/rm360.sc`, `LB2/src/rm370.sc`, `LB2/src/rm400.sc`, `LB2/src/rm420.sc`, `LB2/src/sCountessMeeting.sc`, `LB2/src/rm500.sc`, `LB2/src/rm510.sc`, `LB2/src/rm525.sc`, `LB2/src/rm560.sc`, `LB2/src/Button.sc`, `LB2/src/rm565.sc`, `LB2/src/rm600.sc`, `LB2/src/rm610.sc`, `LB2/src/MyFeature.sc`, `LB2/src/IconI.sc`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/manual/amon-ra.manual.json`, `docs/manual/manual.html`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`.

**Decisions:** D-001 (Floppy base v1.000 preserved), D-002 (Loose patch overrides), D-003 (Interrogation streamlining), D-004 (Unrestricted save/load).

**Verified:** `python3 tools/check_docs.py` (0 errors, 0 warnings); `python3 tools/manual.py check` (5 sections, 29 entries, 0 errors); `manual.py build` (103 KB compiled standalone manual); 3-pass compilation of all 219 scripts in SCI Companion; MD5 verification of base archives.

**Not verified:** Full playthrough regression from start to end in DOSBox-X.

**Problems / surprises:** Wine ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS (183) during script compilation due to case-insensitive rename collisions resolved by automated pre-compile purging and uppercase promotion.

**Corrections:** Self-referencing script dependencies resolved via 3-pass compile all.

**Left undone:** Phase 2 (P2-01 through P2-07) narrative coherence and dialogue accessibility.

**Next session should start with:** Phase 2 implementation starting with P2-01 (inaccessible plot info and notebook fallback triggers for Najir, Miklo, Countess) and P2-02 (pocket watch confrontation timing in Armor Room).

### Session 2: 2026-10-07: Voiceover Policy and Diegetic Act 2 Pacing Integration

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Incorporate maintainer feedback regarding voiceover omission (D-007) and diegetic knowledge progression (D-008).

**Done:** Recorded D-007 (omitting insensitive CD audio tracks, text-first with future voiceover hooks) and D-008
(diegetic knowledge threshold and contextual museum puzzles); updated P2-03 and P3-03 in `docs/ROADMAP.md`,
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/manual/amon-ra.manual.json`, and rebuilt `docs/manual/manual.html`.

**Changed:** `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/manual/manual.html`.

**Decisions:** D-007 (Text-first, omit CD voices, future voice hooks), D-008 (Diegetic knowledge gating for Act 2).

**Verified:** `tools/check_docs.py` passes (0 errors, 0 warnings); `manual.py check` passes (0 errors, 0 warnings).

**Not verified:** In-engine script compilation.

**Problems / surprises:** None.

**Corrections:** None.

**Left undone:** P1-01 through P4-06 implementation.

**Next session should start with:** Decompiling target scripts in SCI Companion and executing P1-04 and P1-03 fixes.

### Session 1: 2026-10-07: Dev Plan & Modernization Roadmap Creation

**Contributor:** Antigravity

**Goal:** Establish development plan, architecture, and roadmap for modernizing The Dagger of Amon Ra using the floppy
release and SCI Companion.

**Done:** Created `docs/ROADMAP.md` covering all 24 items (P1-01 through P4-06); authored `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-001 through D-006, Q-001, Q-002), `docs/TESTING.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`,
`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`; authored and compiled 3x manual `docs/manual/manual.html`.

**Changed:** Initialized project memory and documentation toolchain.

**Decisions:** D-001 (Floppy base v1.000), D-002 (Loose patch overrides), D-003 (Interrogation streamlining),
D-004 (Unrestricted save/load), D-005 (Softlock prevention), D-006 (Inquest scoring standardization).

**Verified:** `tools/check_docs.py` passes; `manual.py check` passes; ScummVM detects game; Wine executes SCI Companion.

**Not verified:** Script decompilation output and in-engine regression saves.

**Problems / surprises:** None.

**Corrections:** None.

**Left undone:** P1-01 through P4-06 implementation.

**Next session should start with:** Decompiling target scripts in SCI Companion and executing P1-04 and P1-03 fixes.
